# üìö EduSketch ‚Äì AI Text-to-Image Generator

**EduSketch** is a fun and simple project that turns educational text prompts into colorful pictures using AI. It is made for students and teachers to help explain school topics through visuals. This project uses Google Colab and the Stable Diffusion AI model.



## üéØ What This Project Does

- Converts topics like ‚Äúsolar system‚Äù or ‚Äúphotosynthesis‚Äù into pictures.
- Helps students understand lessons through visual learning.
- Runs completely on Google Colab ‚Äî no setup needed.




## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Google Colab** (with GPU)
- **Hugging Face Diffusers Library**
- **Stable Diffusion v1.5 AI model**
- **Matplotlib** (for showing images)




## üîë How to Use EduSketch

1. Open the Colab notebook [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1nkRhoqAO7jE7bzT2eDdfO5QEM5HzSLU8?usp=sharing).
2. Click `Runtime > Change runtime type > GPU`.
3. Run the code cells step by step.
4. Enter an educational topic (like ‚Äúwater cycle‚Äù).
5. The AI will show a picture of your topic.





## üñºÔ∏è Examples of Prompts You Can Try

- The water cycle  
- Solar system with all planets  
- Photosynthesis in plants  
- Life cycle of a butterfly  
- Rainwater harvesting  
- A child reading under a tree  



## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Challenges and Their Solutions

| Challenge                  | Solution                            |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Model runs slowly         | Use GPU in Google Colab             |
| Prompt gives poor result  | Add more descriptive keywords       |
| Token safety              | Use `login()` to hide your token    |
| Images not clear          | Add titles using `matplotlib`
